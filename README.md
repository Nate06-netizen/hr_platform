# hr_platform
This is a modern Human Resources (HR) web application built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to browse job listings, filter jobs by category, and view detailed job descriptions. The project uses mock data with localStorage for state management and simulates real-world HR workflows on the frontend.
